                        <h1>Privacy Policy for Silvertrack Cabigo LLP</h1>

<p>At Cabigo, accessible from https://cabigo.in/, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Cabigo and how we use it.</p>

<p>If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for visitors to our website with regards to the information that they shared and/or collect in Cabigo. This policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than this website. Our Privacy Policy was created with the help of the <a href="https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info">Free Privacy Policy Generator</a>.</p>

<h2>Consent</h2>
                        <p style="color:black;">
                        Privacy policy

Information collected for using our services. This includes the following:

Cabigo app collects exact or rough live location data from drivers and customers for a variety of reasons, including to enable rides, allow ride tracking and safety features, prevent and detect fraud, and comply with legal obligations. Cabigo collects this information when their mobile device's Cabigo app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen).
Information about the location (drivers and customers). We gather precise or approximate location data from drivers and customers to enable and improve the usage of our apps, such as to improve pick-ups, enable safety features, and prevent and detect fraud. For more details on how we use this data, please check our Rider Location Help page.

If users' mobile devices allow it, we acquire such information from them. (For details on how drivers and customers can permit location data gathering.) Cabigo collects this information from the time a driver is requested until it is completed (and may indicate this collection via an icon or notification on your mobile device depending on your device's operating system), as well as any time the app is open and on-screen on their mobile device.

The Cabigo apps can be used by drivers and customers without allowing Cabigo to collect precise location data from their mobile devices. However, this may have an impact on Cabigo app functionality. A user who has not enabled location data collection, for example, will be required to manually enter their pick-up address. Furthermore, even if the rider has not authorised location data collection from their device, the location data collected from a driver during a journey will be linked to the rider's account for receipt creation, customer service, fraud detection, insurance, purposes.
